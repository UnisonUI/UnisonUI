# Getting started with UnisonUI

## Running UnisonUI

### Docker

```sh
docker pull unisonui/unisonui
docker run -p 8080:8080 unisonui/unisonui
```

More information about configuring UnisonUI can be found here.

In addition to the previous configuration method you can use variable
environments in order to configure it.

For that take the path, uppercase it and replace the `.` and `-`
respectively by `_` and `__`.

```sh
docker run -p 8081:8081 -e UNISONUI_HTTP_PORT=8081 unisonui/unisonui
```

### Binary

-----

__WARNING__: UnisonUI requires *Java 11+* in order to run.

You can download the binary here.

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/UnisonUI/unisonui/releases/download/v1.0.0/unisonui.zip -o unisonui.zip # Download the package

cd unisonui # Go to the extracted folded
